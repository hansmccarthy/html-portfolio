<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Hans McCarthy. I am 39 years old and a Father of 5 wonderful children.<br />
I am from Alberta Canada. I have started my Web Development journey at the beginning<br />
of 2024.
</p>

<p>I always knew that computers would be in my future. I love technology and what <br />
benefits it brings to all living beings on Earth.  
</p>

<p>This too me is the beginning of a new chapter in my life. I know the basics of using<br />
computers but never really knew how to code or create anything from scratch. I always
wanted to learn how. Now I am doing this and this is my attempt at it. I know I will<br />
continue to learn and get better and better.<br />
